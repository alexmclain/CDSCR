# Length-biased semicompeting risks models for cross-sectional data

These programs will analysis of current duration data that is subjected to semi-competing risks. The details of this model are discussed in McLain et al. (2021) referenced below. To run the programs download the files to a folder, and open the example script document (make sure the folder containing all the files is the working directory). The example script shows an analysis with two sets of example data. In McLain et al. (2021) data from the NSFG is analyzed. The NSFG data is available at the following [website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_questionnaires.htm)



In the paper, cycle 6 through the 2015-2017 data is analyzed (we cannot post NSFG data on this website, but it is all publically available).</p>
